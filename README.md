LateralBench is a multi-turn lateral thinking test that measures lateral thinking, self-awareness, linking disparate subjects and strategic thinking. This public repo is the assembled frontend only. The private backend is built with inspect_ai framework. Thank you to the UK government Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for building public AI infrastructure.
